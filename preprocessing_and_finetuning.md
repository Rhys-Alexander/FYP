# Steps to Preprocess 3D fMRI Data and Adapt 2D Models

## Data Preprocessing:

1. Data Loading:

- Use nibabel to load NIfTI files:

```python
import nibabel as nib
img = nib.load('path_to_file.nii')
data = img.get_fdata()
```

2. Normalization & Registration:

- Normalize voxel intensities (e.g., min-max scaling or z-score normalization).
- Apply spatial registration if necessary using nilearn or other neuroimaging tools.

3. Slice Extraction / Projection:

- **Option 1: Extract Slices:**
  - Choose central or multiple slices along the axial, sagittal, and coronal planes.
  - Save slices as images or convert directly to PyTorch tensors.
- **Option 2: Projection:**
  - Compute maximum intensity projections (MIP) or average projections to reduce 3D data to 2D.

4. Data Augmentation:

- Implement augmentation (e.g., rotations, flips) using PyTorch’s `torchvision.transforms` for 2D images.

## Adapting 2D Models:

### Model Input Adjustment:

- For slice-based approaches, ensure each 2D image is preprocessed to match the input size expected by the pre-trained model.
- If using multi-view input, stack slices as channels (e.g., a 3-channel input with different views).

### Layer Modification:

- Replace the final fully-connected layer with a layer that outputs a single value or two classes for Alzheimer’s detection.
- Consider aggregating predictions across slices with simple averaging or a secondary classifier.

# How to Fine-Tune a Pre-Trained Model for Alzheimer’s Detection

## Select a Pre-trained Model:

For example, use ResNet-18 or ResNet-50 from PyTorch’s `torchvision.models`.

## Modify the Architecture:

### Replace the final layer(s):

```python
import torchvision.models as models
import torch.nn as nn

model = models.resnet18(pretrained=True)
num_features = model.fc.in_features
model.fc = nn.Linear(num_features, 2)  # for binary classification
```

### Freeze & Unfreeze Layers:

- Initially freeze early layers:
  ```python
  for param in model.parameters():
          param.requires_grad = False
  for param in model.fc.parameters():
          param.requires_grad = True
  ```
- Later unfreeze layers gradually for fine-tuning with a lower learning rate.

## Training Setup:

- Define the loss function (e.g., `nn.CrossEntropyLoss` or `nn.BCEWithLogitsLoss` for binary tasks).
- Choose an optimizer like Adam, and set up learning rate scheduling:
  ```python
  optimizer = torch.optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=1e-4)
  scheduler = torch.optim.lr_scheduler.StepLR(optimizer, step_size=5, gamma=0.1)
  ```
- Use early stopping to prevent overfitting.

## Training Loop:

- Iterate over epochs, monitor training and validation losses, and adjust hyperparameters as needed.
- Log metrics and use tools like TensorBoard for visualization.
