# Dissertation Writing Plan

## Results, and lit review (Wednesday)

- Document 3-fold cross validation results and statistical significance

### Results Section (Morning)

Since you've already conducted experiments:

1. **Performance Metrics**

   - Document accuracy, precision, recall metrics
   - Include training/validation curves
   - Compare different model configurations

2. **Analysis of Model Performance**
   - Interpret your ~70% accuracy results
   - Compare frozen vs. unfrozen layer performance

### Literature Review (Wednesday Afternoon - Thursday)

This provides context for your work:

2. **Literature Review**
   - Review Alzheimer's biomarkers (expanding your notes)
   - Discuss previous ML approaches for AD detection
   - Establish gap your research addresses

### Code

**Implement XAI analysis**

- Generate GradCAM or other activation maps
- Correlate with anatomical regions (particularly hippocampus)
- Document findings for Results section 4.4

## Complete Discussion & Limitations (Thursday - Friday Morning)

1. **Discussion**

   - Interpret results in context of literature
   - Discuss implications for clinical application
   - Analyze performance relative to expectations

2. **Limitations & Future Work**
   - Technical limitations (computational resources)
   - Dataset constraints
   - Outline your planned XAI and k-fold validation work

## Finish with Conclusion, Intro, and Abstract (Friday Afternoon)

1. **Conclusion**

   - Summarize key findings
   - Restate contribution to the field
   - Final thoughts on transfer learning viability

2. **Introduction**

   - Establish Alzheimer's significance and diagnosis challenges
   - Present your research question and approach
   - Outline contribution (transfer learning from video models)

3. **Abstract**
   - Write this last as a summary of the entire work

## Following Week (Post-draft refinement)

1. **Perform final evaluation comparisons**

   - Compare with 2D approach results
   - Research and compile state-of-art benchmarks
   - Run Bayesian analysis with realistic class distributions

2. **Complete Results and Discussion**

   - Incorporate feedback from draft review
   - Integrate XAI and final evaluation results
   - Refine visualizations and tables

3. **Finalize Literature Review**

   - Ensure comprehensive coverage of recent work
   - Strengthen justification for your approach

4. **Polish Discussion and Conclusion**

   - Critical analysis of limitations
   - Clear articulation of contributions
   - Compelling future work directions

5. **Final assembly and editing**
   - Check formatting, citations, and references
   - Review for coherence and flow
   - Proofread carefully
