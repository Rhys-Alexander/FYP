# General Ideas

## Advanced Web Application Development

**Description:**  
This project focuses on creating complex, high-performance web applications using advanced web technologies. You will learn about responsive design, client-server architecture, and integrating various APIs and databases. You will need to identify a problem to be solved, but that is something you can discuss with your supervisor. If you are unsure of what to do for your project but know that you would like to create software, this is a very sensible choice.

**Skills:**  
HTML, CSS, JavaScript, server-side languages (e.g., Node.js, Python), database technologies (e.g., MySQL, MongoDB), API integration, security best practices.

**Extra Idea:**  
You could enhance your project by incorporating some industry focus, perhaps by doing market research, a user study, or working directly with a business.

## Automated Grading of Written English

**Description:**  
Develop an automated system for grading written English using natural language processing and machine learning techniques. The project aims to accurately assess grammar, vocabulary, and overall coherence of written English. You could also explore the wider ethical and social implications and biases in automated grading.

**Skills:**  
Natural Language Processing, machine learning, text analysis, ethics.

**Extra Idea:**  
Once you can accurately assess the standard of writing, you might like to see if high-quality writing correlates with positive or negative sentiment in some contexts. For example, do positive restaurant reviews have a better standard of English?

## Social Media Sentiment Analysis for Brand Management

**Description:**  
Develop a tool for analysing social media sentiment to aid in brand management and marketing strategy development. You could work with real-time data, applying machine learning algorithms to detect public sentiment towards brands. The project also involves visualising and interpreting sentiment analysis results.

**Skills:**  
Data mining, sentiment analysis, machine learning, data visualisation.

**Extra Idea:**  
Once you are able to track movements in sentiment towards a brand, you might think about how your system can support targeted interventions that enhance brand perception.

## Peer-to-Peer File Sharing System

**Description:**  
Build a peer-to-peer file sharing application, focusing on network programming and data security. The project involves creating a scalable, decentralised system that allows users to share files. You will need to address challenges in file transfer efficiency, data privacy, network security, and usability.

**Skills:**  
Network programming, distributed systems, security protocols, file handling, UI/UX design.

**Extra Idea:**  
Peer-to-Peer systems inherently provide some elements of fault tolerance and stability but present other challenges. For example, how can you maximise the ability of the system to securely make files available, even when the owner of the file is not online?

## Automated Plagiarism Detection

**Description:**  
Develop a software tool for detecting plagiarism in academic writing and/or source code. The project involves implementing comparison algorithms and/or machine learning models to identify the extent of similarities. The project will also need to address the procedural and ethical aspects of plagiarism and detection accuracy.

**Skills:**  
Text processing, algorithm development, machine learning, software development, ethics.

**Extra Idea:**  
Rather than thinking about plagiarism checks as an after-the-fact process that is computed on digital files, you might like to think about how plagiarism detection can be performed during the software development process or integrated into assessment practice.

## Playing Games and Solving Puzzles Using AI

**Description:**  
Design and implement an AI system to play games or solve puzzles. The project includes developing algorithms that implement defined strategies and adaptive learning. You will need to test your AI in various game environments or puzzle scenarios. Picking an interesting game or puzzle to solve is a great starting point. The classics, e.g., Chess, are well studied but there are alternatives that have properties all their own (e.g., HexCells).

**Skills:**  
Artificial intelligence, machine learning, algorithm design, programming, problem-solving.

**Extra Idea:**  
Rather than implement a single algorithm, you could present a comparative study that considers different approaches/algorithms for playing a game or solving a puzzle.

## A Comparative Study of Machine Learning Algorithms

**Description:**  
Conduct a comprehensive study comparing various machine learning algorithms that solve a well-defined problem. The project involves applying classic and state-of-the-art algorithms to established datasets, analysing their performance, and understanding their strengths and limitations in particular domains. A variant of this project would be the comparison of movie recommendation algorithms. Finding sufficient and interesting datasets is vital for this project, hence exploring Kaggle and similar machine learning repositories is a good idea.

**Skills:**  
Machine learning, statistical analysis, data processing, comparative analysis, research.

**Extra Idea:**  
All machine learning algorithms are not created equal. Some require large volumes of data, and some require considerable computational resources. Imposing constraints under which the algorithms must operate is one way to enhance your comparative study.

## Travelling Salesperson Heuristics

**Description:**  
Explore and implement heuristic algorithms to solve the Travelling Salesperson Problem. You will evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of selected heuristics and understand the complexities of the problem. The project includes theoretical and practical algorithm design and development, as well as the opportunity to show real-world applications of a classical problem.

**Skills:**  
Algorithm design, optimisation techniques, computational mathematics, programming skills.

**Extra Idea:**  
As interesting as it is to see the Travelling Salesperson Problem applied in the abstract, it is often more interesting to see it applied in a useful context. Finding an application domain, from delivery driving to microprocessor design, can significantly enhance the project.

## Cloud-Based File Storage and Sharing System

**Description:**  
Create a secure, scalable cloud-based file storage and sharing system. The project involves developing a cloud platform, which will require you to implement security protocols and develop a user interface for file management.

**Skills:**  
Cloud computing, cyber security, database management, UI/UX design.

**Extra Idea:**  
Providing users with fine-grained control of the security protocols and advanced permissions that will be applied in the storage and communication of their files.

## Location-aware Social Networking

**Description:**  
Develop a location-aware social networking platform. The project involves integrating geolocation technology to provide location-based services, such that individual users can benefit from interactions with users and businesses in close proximity. You will need to consider the social and ethical implementations of location-based social networking, as well as addressing privacy concerns and optimising user experiences for a mobile platform.

**Skills:**  
Mobile development, geolocation technology, data privacy, UI/UX design, ethics.

**Extra Idea:**  
Once you can permit businesses to market to prospective customers who happen to be in close proximity, you could explore ways to monetise that opportunity.

## Chatbot for Customer Advice

**Description:**  
Create an AI chatbot that provides customer advice and support. The project involves programming the chatbot to understand and respond to user queries effectively. It also includes testing and refining the chatbot for a wide range of customer interactions. The advent of large language models makes it tempting to think about general-purpose advice chatbots, but if you select a domain appropriately, you might be able to go further.

**Skills:**  
AI, natural language processing, chatbot development frameworks, user experience design.

**Extra Idea:**  
University regulations and legal documents are good examples of structured documentation that can be difficult to traverse. Developing a chatbot that can assist with the interpretation of these documents would be useful for all concerned.
