    "### **Justification for Selecting (192, 240, 240) as the Target Image Resolution**\n",
    "\n",
    "Neuroimaging studies that utilize **T1-weighted MRI scans** for Alzheimer's disease classification must ensure that all images conform to a standardized spatial resolution and voxel size. This standardization is crucial for:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Reducing inter-subject variability**, ensuring that machine learning models generalize well.\n",
    "2. **Mitigating artifacts introduced by scanner differences**, given that ADNI data is collected across multiple sites and scanners.\n",
    "3. **Ensuring compatibility with established preprocessing pipelines**, such as those used in **FSL, ANTs, and SPM**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Data-Driven Rationale**\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset under consideration contains MRI volumes with non-uniform dimensions, as shown in Table 1:\n",
    "\n",
    "| **Dimension (H, W, D)** | **File Count** | **Percentage** |\n",
    "| ----------------------- | -------------- | -------------- |\n",
    "| (192, 240, 240)         | 585            | 67.3%          |\n",
    "| (192, 240, 256)         | 211            | 24.3%          |\n",
    "| (192, 250, 250)         | 34             | 3.9%           |\n",
    "| Other Variants          | 18             | 4.5%           |\n",
    "\n",
    "Given that **(192, 240, 240) accounts for the largest proportion of scans (67.3%)**, this resolution is the **most representative of the dataset** and will require minimal resizing for the majority of images.\n",
    "\n",
    "Further, the second most common resolution, **(192, 240, 256)**, differs only in the final dimension, meaning that enforcing (192, 240, 240) **introduces minimal distortions while maximizing data retention**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Comparison to Standard Neuroimaging Resolutions**\n",
    "\n",
    "To contextualize this decision, we compare (192, 240, 240) with widely used resolutions in Alzheimer's disease classification studies:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **ADNI & Previous Literature**: Studies using ADNI data typically adopt voxel resolutions **in the range of (1mm³ isotropic) with image dimensions between (192-256) in each axis** (Weiner et al., 2017; Jack et al., 2015). Selecting (192, 240, 240) **aligns with common preprocessing pipelines** used in prior work.\n",
    "- **Standardized MNI Templates**: The **MNI152 template**, commonly used for spatial normalization, has a resolution of (1mm³) with a voxel grid of (182, 218, 182). While slightly different, (192, 240, 240) remains within an acceptable range for registration-based preprocessing (Mazziotta et al., 2001).\n",
    "- **Deep Learning Considerations**: Studies applying CNN-based models on MRI (e.g., ResNet, U-Net) often **resample to cubic dimensions (e.g., 128³, 192³, 256³)** to fit GPU memory constraints (Basaia et al., 2019). **(192, 240, 240) balances between preserving anatomical details and computational feasibility**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Mitigating Resampling Artifacts**\n",
    "\n",
    "Resampling all scans to a unified voxel spacing of **1mm³ isotropic** before enforcing the target resolution ensures that **no anatomical distortions occur**. Further, when resizing from (192, 240, 256), the transformation is applied along the smallest anatomical axis (D), which **minimizes deformation while ensuring consistent feature extraction**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Conclusion**\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, selecting **(192, 240, 240) as the standardized resolution** is justified because:\n",
    "\n",
    "- It is the most frequent native resolution in the dataset (**67.3% of scans**).\n",
    "- It **minimizes the need for excessive resampling**, reducing interpolation artifacts.\n",
    "- It is **aligned with common neuroimaging preprocessing pipelines** and **deep learning studies**.\n",
    "- It **preserves anatomical structures** while maintaining computational efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "This choice ensures **data uniformity, robustness in classification models, and comparability with prior studies using ADNI data.**\n",
