\subsection{Data Acquisition and Characteristics}

The Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database served as the primary data source, providing standardized MRI acquisitions with corresponding clinical diagnoses. ADNI was selected over alternatives (including OASIS) for its comprehensive coverage, acquisition protocols, and expert-validated diagnoses.

\subsubsection{Dataset Composition}

All selected scans were T1-weighted MPRAGE sequences (1.5T or 3T, 1mm³ isotropic resolution), chosen for optimal gray/white matter contrast, standardized acquisition parameters, and sensitivity to atrophy biomarkers. Additionally, the widespread clinical availability and established role of MPRAGE in AD assessment made it an ideal choice for this study. The final dataset contained 1,300 scans from 408 unique subjects, balanced between diagnostic categories:

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|}
\hline
\textbf{Partition} & \textbf{AD} & \textbf{CN} \\
\hline
Training & 512 scans (133 subjects) & 511 scans (115 subjects) \\
Validation & 69 scans (35 subjects) & 70 scans (45 subjects) \\
Test & 69 scans (35 subjects) & 69 scans (45 subjects) \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Distribution of scans and subjects across dataset partitions}
\end{table}

\subsubsection{Diagnostic Criteria}

Subjects were classified as Alzheimer's Disease (AD) or Cognitively Normal (CN) based on NINCDS-ADRDA criteria. Initially, the dataset contained approximately 33\% AD and 67\% CN cases. To address class imbalance and potential overfitting issues identified during preliminary experiments, additional AD scans were incorporated and CN subjects carefully sampled to achieve a balanced 50/50 diagnostic distribution.

The binary classification focus (excluding Mild Cognitive Impairment) reflects the clearer structural changes observable in established AD, particularly hippocampal atrophy, which serves as a primary biomarker for disease progression. Subject-level isolation between dataset partitions was strictly enforced to prevent data leakage, ensuring realistic performance assessment for unseen individuals.

\subsection{Preprocessing Pipeline}

\subsubsection{Initial Processing and Skull Stripping}

Raw DICOM images were converted to NIfTI format using \texttt{dicom2nifti} with reorientation and compression enabled. This created unified volumetric files suitable for 3D analysis. Skull stripping was performed using SynthStrip, a deep learning-based method that represents the current state-of-the-art for brain extraction. It was selected for its superior performance with atrophied brains. Unlike traditional threshold-based methods (e.g., BET), SynthStrip preserved critical cortical boundaries even with atrophied brains and better handled the variability in the ADNI dataset. Despite requiring ~2.5 minutes per scan, the improved quality justified this approach by preventing potential misinterpretation of artifacts as disease-related changes.
% TODO add referneces from synth strip paper

\subsubsection{Volume Standardization}

All volumes were resampled to isotropic 1×1×1mm voxels using ANTs with third-order spline interpolation. This standardization ensured consistent spatial representation, eliminated scanner-specific resolution variability, and enabled uniform convolutional filter operations across all dimensions.

\subsubsection{Adaptive Cropping Strategy}

A key methodological innovation was the implementation of an adaptive cropping procedure followed by reshaping to 128×128×128 dimensions. The approach:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Identified brain-containing regions using intensity thresholding
    \item Applied cropping with minimal padding (3 voxels)
    \item Used cubic interpolation to reach the target dimensions
\end{enumerate}
% TODO add appendix to crop brain from mri function

This method preserved approximately 35\% more effective resolution for critical structures like the hippocampus compared to naive downsampling. The 128³ dimension balanced preserving anatomical detail with memory constraints for model training.
% TODO include figures demostarting the 96 uncropped vs 128 cropped

\subsubsection{Intensity Normalization and Orientation}

N4 bias field correction was applied to mitigate intensity inhomogeneities from magnetic field variations. This prevents intensity variations that might be misinterpreted as structural changes. All volumes were reoriented to Right-Anterior-Superior (RAS) orientation to ensure consistent directionality, allowing the model to focus solely on relevant structural differences rather than arbitrary orientation variations.
% TODO reference code from appendix

\subsubsection{Omission of Spatial Normalization}

Despite its common use in neuroimaging pipelines, registration to standard space (e.g., MNI152) was deliberately omitted for several reasons:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Preservation of native atrophy patterns that could be distorted during normalization
    \item Reliance on CNN translation invariance to identify structures without explicit alignment
    \item Avoidance of interpolation artifacts that might smooth critical structural boundaries
    \item Computational efficiency gains without compromising classification performance
\end{enumerate}

Validation experiments confirmed that models trained on native-space data performed comparably to or better than those using normalized data, supporting this methodological decision and aligning with recent literature suggesting deep learning models for brain MRI benefit from native-space learning.

The entire pipeline produced 1,300 preprocessed volumes with consistent dimensions, orientation, and intensity characteristics while preserving the structural variations essential for AD classification.

\subsection{Data Splitting Strategy}

A methodologically rigorous data splitting approach was implemented to prevent data leakage while maintaining diagnostic balance across partitions. Unlike conventional image classification tasks, neuroimaging datasets require subject-level rather than scan-level splitting since multiple scans often exist for the same individual.

\subsubsection{Subject-Level Isolation}

A strict subject-level isolation approach ensured no individual appeared in multiple dataset partitions—a critical decision after initial experiments revealed artificially inflated performance metrics (~90\% accuracy) when subjects were allowed to cross partition boundaries. Complete subject isolation produced a more realistic performance assessment (~70\% accuracy), better reflecting the model's generalization capability to unseen individuals.
% TODO add a figure showing the difference in accuracy with and without subject isolation

\subsubsection{Partition Distribution}

The dataset was divided following an 80/10/10 (train/validation/test) ratio using a round-robin algorithm that:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Grouped subjects by diagnostic condition
    \item Sorted subjects in ascending order by scan count
    \item Allocated subjects to partitions round robin to insure subject diversity across partitions
    \item Final scan counts were balanced to maintain equal scan counts per diagnostic category
\end{enumerate}

This approach yielded a balanced distribution with 1,023 training scans (512 AD/511 CN), 139 validation scans (69 AD/70 CN), and 138 test scans (69 AD/69 CN). The strict isolation maintained 203 unique subjects in training, 80 in validation, and 80 in test sets, with diagnostic balance preserved in each partition.

\paragraph{Data Leakage Prevention}

To prevent subtle forms of data leakage, subject identifiers were rigorously tracked and preprocessing parameters (such as intensity normalization statistics) were computed independently within each partition. This methodologically sound approach ensured that performance metrics would accurately reflect the model's ability to generalize to entirely new individuals, rather than merely recognizing previously seen subjects in different scans.
% TODO refer to previous research that didn't do this

\subsection{Data Augmentation}

Data augmentation was strategically implemented to improve model generalization by exposing the network to controlled variations while preserving clinically relevant features. The augmentation pipeline evolved through experimental validation to balance diversity enhancement with preservation of diagnostic information.

\subsubsection{Augmentation Strategy Development}

The augmentation approach underwent several iterations, beginning with a comprehensive set of transformations adapted from general computer vision practices. Through systematic evaluation, the final pipeline was refined to include only those transformations that demonstrably improved generalization without distorting critical diagnostic features:

\begin{verbatim}
tio.Compose(
  [
      tio.RandomNoise(mean=0.0, std=0.1, p=0.3),
      tio.RandomGamma(log_gamma=(-0.2, 0.2), p=0.3),
      tio.ZNormalization(),
  ]
\end{verbatim}

This minimalist approach was adopted after observing that more aggressive transformations either failed to improve performance or actively degraded it. The augmentation pipeline was applied exclusively to the training set, while validation and test sets received only intensity normalization to maintain evaluation consistency.

\subsubsection{Justification for Selected Techniques}

Each augmentation technique was selected based on specific neuroimaging considerations:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Random Noise Addition}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Simulates natural scanner variability and noise artifacts
        \item Promotes robustness to image quality variations across scanning sites
        \item Implemented with a moderate noise level to preserve structural integrity
        \item 30\% probability prevents overreliance on noise-resilient features
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Random Gamma Adjustment}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Simulates intensity variations common in MRI acquisition
        \item Enhances model robustness to contrast differences between scanners
        \item Restricted to a narrow range to preserve anatomical relationships
        \item Complements the bias field correction applied during preprocessing
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Z-Score Normalization} (applied to all volumes)
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Standardizes intensity values to zero mean and unit variance
        \item Critical for consistent feature extraction across scans
        \item Mitigates the effect of scanner-specific intensity scales
        \item Applied to all datasets (not just training) to ensure consistent input distribution
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

% TODO add demonstration of normalisation effectiveness from post-aug-norm

\subsubsection{Augmentation Impact Analysis}

Notably, several common augmentation techniques were deliberately excluded after experimental evaluation showed they either provided no benefit or negatively impacted performance:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Geometric Transformations} (rotations, flips):
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Initial experiments included rotations ($\pm$90°) and random flips
        \item These transformations significantly increased training time ($\sim$20 epochs vs. $\sim$5 epochs to converge)
        \item Provided no measurable improvement in validation accuracy
        \item Likely redundant given the inherent orientation variability already present in MRI data
        \item May have introduced unrealistic transformations not encountered in clinical settings
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Random Scaling}:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Initially tested with scale factors of 0.9-1.1
        \item Showed no significant improvement in generalization
        \item Potentially disrupted the carefully standardized voxel dimensions established during preprocessing
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

The progression from extensive transformations (using MONAI's comprehensive augmentation library) to a more focused set (using TorchIO's targeted medical imaging augmentations) and finally to the minimal set described above reflected an evidence-based refinement process. This evolution was guided by systematically monitoring validation performance and convergence speed after each modification.

The final augmentation strategy represents an optimal balance between enhancing model robustness and preserving the clinically significant structural features essential for accurate AD classification, particularly the hippocampal atrophy patterns that serve as primary biomarkers.

\subsection{Model Architectures}
\subsubsection{3D ResNet Architecture}

The primary model architecture employed was a modified 3D ResNet-18 (r3d\_18), selected for several key characteristics:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Residual connections}: These skip connections mitigate the vanishing gradient problem in deep networks, allowing effective training even with limited data.
    
    \item \textbf{3D convolutions}: Unlike 2D approaches that process each slice independently, 3D convolutions capture volumetric patterns across all three dimensions, preserving spatial relationships critical for detecting hippocampal atrophy.
    
    \item \textbf{Parameter efficiency}: With approximately 33 million parameters, ResNet-18 offered a balance between model capacity and computational efficiency, enabling training on consumer hardware.
    
    \item \textbf{Proven effectiveness}: The ResNet architecture family has demonstrated robust performance across numerous computer vision tasks, including medical imaging applications.
\end{enumerate}

% TODO add resnet diagram

The implementation utilized the PyTorch \texttt{torchvision.models.video} module, specifically the \texttt{r3d\_18} model pre-trained on the Kinetics400 action recognition dataset.The first convolutional layer was modified to accept single-channel MRI volumes rather than the three-channel RGB videos used in the original architecture. The final fully connected layer was replaced to output two classes (AD vs. CN) instead of the 400 action classes in the original model. These architectural modifications preserved the core feature extraction capabilities of the ResNet model while adapting it to the specific requirements of binary volumetric MRI classification.

\subsubsection{Transfer Learning Strategy}

A systematic transfer learning approach was implemented with layer freezing to leverage the pre-trained weights from video classification. Early convolutional layers (stem, layer1, layer2, layer3) were frozen to preserve general low-level feature detectors learned from video data. The final residual block (layer4) and fully connected layer were unfrozen to allow adaptation to MRI-specific features. This approach maintained approximately 25\% of parameters as frozen (8.2 million) while fine-tuning the remaining 75\% (24.9 million), striking a balance between preserving pre-trained knowledge and adapting to the target domain. Initial experiments with more aggressive freezing (keeping only the final fully connected layer trainable) resulted in numerical instabilities during training, manifested as NaN losses, suggesting that significant domain adaptation was necessary given the substantial differences between video action recognition and MRI classification.

Notably, the learning rate strategy was aligned with this transfer learning approach, implementing a higher learning rate (10×) for the newly initialized fully connected layer compared to the pre-trained but unfrozen convolutional layers. This differential learning rate strategy allowed more aggressive adaptation in the task-specific output layer while making more conservative updates to the pre-trained feature extraction layers.
% TODO add a figure showing the difference in learning rates maybe point to the code

\subsubsection{Alternative Architecture Exploration}

To validate the architectural choices, and to justify using 3D convolutioons as opposed to the previously researched 2D methods, alternative models were explored:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Mixed Convolution 3D Network}: This model (MC3-18) uses a hybrid approach combining 2D and 3D convolutions, hypothesized to potentially offer computational efficiency while maintaining performance.
      
      Experimental results with MC3-18 showed less stable training dynamics and inferior performance compared to the pure 3D approach of R3D-18, supporting the importance of fully volumetric feature extraction for structural MRI analysis. The differences in performance provided empirical justification for the primary architectural choice.
      % TODO add graph

    \item \textbf{(2+1)D Convolution Network}: Following the investigation of MC3-18, a (2+1)D architecture was also evaluated. This approach decomposes 3D convolutions into separate spatial (2D) and temporal (1D) convolutions, a technique that has shown promise in video classification tasks.
      
      Results with the (2+1)D architecture revealed performance that was slightly worse than MC3-18, continuing the observed trend that classification accuracy decreased as the model architecture incorporated more 2D elements. This progression (R3D > MC3 > (2+1)D) strongly suggests that preserving the full 3D spatial context through pure 3D convolutions is critical for detecting the subtle volumetric patterns associated with Alzheimer's disease in MRI data.
      % TODO add graph
      
    \item \textbf{Multiscale Vision Transformer}: Recent advances in vision transformers prompted investigation of their potential for 3D MRI classification. However, initial implementation attempts revealed significant computational barriers:
      
      \begin{enumerate}
        \item Memory requirements exceeded available hardware capabilities (32GB RAM requirement for 128×128×128 volumes)
        \item Architectural mismatch between the input dimensions required by MViT (designed for 16×224×224 video clips) and the cubical 128×128×128 MRI volumes
        \item Transformer architectures typically require substantially larger training datasets than were available
      \end{enumerate}
      
      These constraints prevented full evaluation of transformer-based approaches, highlighting an important practical limitation in applying state-of-the-art vision models to medical imaging with limited computational resources.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Parameter Counts and Computational Considerations}

The final model architecture parameters were:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Total parameters}: 33,148,482
    \item \textbf{Trainable parameters}: 24,909,826 (75.15\%)
    \item \textbf{Frozen parameters}: 8,238,656 (24.85\%)
\end{itemize}

These figures represent a significant reduction compared to larger architectures like ResNet-50 or ViT variants, making training feasible on consumer-grade hardware while maintaining sufficient capacity for the classification task. The reduced parameter count also potentially mitigated overfitting given the relatively small dataset size.

\subsection{Training Framework and Implementation}

\subsubsection{Computational Environment}

Model training was conducted on an M1 Mac using the Metal Performance Shaders (MPS) acceleration framework. This hardware configuration imposed certain constraints on the implementation, with each epoch requiring approximately one hour of computation time and total training runs taking upwards of 20 hours. These hardware limitations influenced several implementation decisions, including batch size selection and model architecture choices.

While attempts were made to optimize training speed through techniques like mixed precision training and CPU-GPU synchronization optimization, performance improvements were minimal. The majority of computational time was consumed by the model's forward pass through the 3D volumes, which could not be significantly accelerated without more powerful hardware.

\subsubsection{Hyperparameter Selection}

Hyperparameters were carefully selected through systematic experimentation and validation performance tracking. The final configuration included:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Learning rate strategy}: A dual learning rate approach was implemented, with the newly initialized fully connected layer receiving a 10× higher learning rate (0.001) compared to the fine-tuned convolutional layers (0.0001). This differential strategy allowed more aggressive adaptation in the task-specific output layer while making conservative updates to the pre-trained feature extraction layers.
    
    \item \textbf{Optimizer}: AdamW with weight decay (0.01) was selected to mitigate overfitting given the relatively small dataset size. The weight decay regularization helped constrain the model's parameter space, particularly important when working with pre-trained features.
    
    \item \textbf{Batch size}: Limited to 2 samples per batch due to memory constraints of processing 128$\times$128$\times$128 volumetric inputs. Despite the small batch size, training stability was maintained through appropriate learning rate selection.
    
    \item \textbf{Learning rate scheduling}: Cosine annealing with warm restarts ($T_0=5$) was implemented to prevent convergence to local minima. This scheduling strategy periodically reduces the learning rate following a cosine curve before resetting it, allowing the model to escape suboptimal solutions.
\end{itemize}

The hyperparameter selection process was guided by both theoretical considerations and empirical validation, with each configuration tracked in Weights \& Biases to enable systematic comparison.

\subsubsection{Loss Function and Class Weighting}

A weighted cross-entropy loss function was implemented to address potential class imbalance, particularly important during initial experiments when the dataset had not yet been fully balanced:

\begin{verbatim}
# Calculate class weights for imbalanced data
num_ad = train_dataset.labels.count(1)
num_cn = train_dataset.labels.count(0)
total = num_ad + num_cn

# Inverse frequency weighting
weight_cn = total / (2 * num_cn) if num_cn > 0 else 1.0
weight_ad = total / (2 * num_ad) if num_ad > 0 else 1.0

class_weights = torch.tensor([weight_cn, weight_ad], device=device)
criterion = nn.CrossEntropyLoss(weight=class_weights)
\end{verbatim}

This weighting strategy ensured that both diagnostic classes contributed equally to the loss function regardless of their representation in the training set. The weights were dynamically calculated for each training run based on the actual class distribution, providing robustness to dataset modifications.

\subsubsection{Early Stopping Criteria}

To prevent overfitting and optimize computational resource usage, an early stopping mechanism was implemented with a patience of 5 epochs. This approach monitored validation metrics (accuracy and loss) and terminated training when no improvement was observed for five consecutive epochs. The early stopping implementation maintained separate counters for accuracy and loss improvements, ensuring training continued as long as either metric showed enhancement. This dual-metric approach prevented premature termination in cases where one metric had plateaued while the other continued to improve.

In practice, most models converged within 5-10 epochs, with early stopping typically triggering around epoch 7-8. This relatively quick convergence was partly attributable to the transfer learning approach, which provided a strong initialization for the model.

\subsubsection{Checkpoint Management}

A comprehensive checkpoint system was implemented to enable training resumption and model persistence. The system saved three types of checkpoints:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Regular checkpoints}: Saved at the end of each epoch to enable training resumption in case of interruption
    \item \textbf{Best accuracy model}: Updated whenever a new best validation accuracy was achieved
    \item \textbf{Best loss model}: Updated whenever a new best validation loss was achieved
\end{enumerate}

Each checkpoint stored model weights, optimizer state, scheduler state, and performance metrics to ensure seamless training resumption. Additionally, the checkpoint system integrated with Weights \& Biases to log best-performing models as artifacts, facilitating later access and deployment.

\subsubsection{Training Loop Implementation}

The training loop was implemented with careful attention to numerical stability and memory management. Memory optimization techniques included setting gradients to \texttt{None} rather than zero (reducing memory fragmentation) and using tensor operations that maintained computational efficiency. For MPS acceleration, explicit cache clearing was performed at the end of each epoch to prevent memory accumulation.

\subsection{Evaluation Methodology}

\subsubsection{Classification Metrics Selection}

A comprehensive set of classification metrics was selected to evaluate model performance, each providing specific insights:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Accuracy}: While providing an intuitive overall measure of classification performance, accuracy alone was recognized as potentially misleading for medical applications. This metric was supplemented with more nuanced measures.
    
    \item \textbf{Balanced accuracy}: Calculated as the arithmetic mean of sensitivity and specificity, this metric was particularly important given the potential clinical consequences of both false positives and false negatives in AD diagnosis.
    
    \item \textbf{Class-specific accuracy}: Separate accuracy calculations for AD and CN classes provided insight into potential class-specific biases in the model.
    
    \item \textbf{Precision and recall}: These metrics were critical for understanding the model's performance in terms of clinical relevance:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Precision (positive predictive value) quantified the proportion of positive predictions that were correct, important for avoiding unnecessary interventions.
        \item Recall (sensitivity) measured the model's ability to identify actual AD cases, crucial for early detection and intervention.
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item \textbf{Specificity}: Calculated from the confusion matrix as $TN/(TN+FP)$, this metric quantified the model's ability to correctly identify CN cases, important for avoiding false alarms.
    
    \item \textbf{F1-score}: The harmonic mean of precision and recall provided a balanced measure that was particularly valuable given the clinical importance of both metrics in AD detection.
    
    \item \textbf{ROC-AUC}: The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve measured the model's ability to distinguish between classes across different classification thresholds, providing a threshold-independent performance assessment.
    
    \item \textbf{Average precision}: Calculated as the area under the precision-recall curve, this metric provided additional insight into model performance, particularly valuable in medical contexts where class imbalance may be present.
\end{enumerate}

This comprehensive metric set was implemented through the \texttt{MetricsManager} class, which calculated and logged all metrics at each evaluation stage:

\begin{verbatim}
metrics = {
    "accuracy": accuracy_score(labels, preds),
    "balanced_accuracy": balanced_accuracy_score(labels, preds),
    "precision": precision,
    "recall": recall,
    "specificity": tn / (tn + fp + 1e-10),
    "f1_score": f1,
    "roc_auc": roc_auc_score(labels, probs),
    "avg_precision": average_precision_score(labels, probs)
}
\end{verbatim}

\subsubsection{Validation Strategy}

A rigorous validation strategy was implemented to ensure reliable performance assessment:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Independent validation set}: A dedicated validation set (10\% of data) was maintained completely separate from training data, with strict subject-level isolation to prevent data leakage.
    
    \item \textbf{Held-out test set}: A completely separate test set (also 10\% of data) was reserved for final model evaluation, never used during model development or hyperparameter tuning.
    
    \item \textbf{Multiple checkpoints}: To mitigate potential bias from checkpoint selection, two separate best model checkpoints were saved:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Best accuracy model: Updated whenever validation accuracy improved
        \item Best loss model: Updated whenever validation loss decreased
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item \textbf{Continuous tracking}: Performance metrics were monitored throughout training using Weights \& Biases, enabling detailed analysis of convergence patterns and potential overfitting.
\end{enumerate}

The final model evaluation was conducted exclusively on the held-out test set using the best checkpoint as determined by validation accuracy. This provided an unbiased estimate of the model's performance on new, unseen data.

\subsubsection{Statistical Analysis Approach}

Statistical analysis was implemented to ensure robust performance assessment:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Confidence intervals}: Bootstrap confidence intervals were calculated for key metrics to quantify the uncertainty in performance estimates.
    
    \item \textbf{Confusion matrix analysis}: Detailed analysis of the confusion matrix provided insights into the patterns of correct and incorrect classifications, particularly important for identifying potential biases in model predictions.
    
    \item \textbf{Comparison to baseline}: Model performance was compared to:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Random chance (50\% for balanced classes)
        \item Reported clinical accuracy ranges for radiologist assessment
        \item Previously published algorithmic approaches using 2D slice-based methods
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item \textbf{Probability distribution analysis}: The distribution of prediction probabilities was analyzed to assess model calibration and confidence, providing insights beyond binary classification performance.
\end{enumerate}

The statistical analysis approach was designed to provide a comprehensive understanding of model performance rather than relying on any single metric.

\subsubsection{Cross-Validation Approach}

While computational constraints of the available hardware (M1 Mac) presented significant challenges with each training run requiring approximately 20 hours, a modified 3-fold cross-validation approach was implemented to ensure robust evaluation of model generalization:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Subject-level 3-fold cross-validation}: The dataset was partitioned into three distinct folds, with subject-level isolation maintained across all partitions. This approach ensured that:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Each subject appeared in exactly one fold
        \item Diagnostic balance was preserved within each fold 
        \item The model was evaluated on all available data while maintaining strict separation between training and evaluation subjects
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item \textbf{Multiple architecture evaluation}: Performance was assessed across different model architectures (R3D-18, MC3-18, R2Plus1D-18) to evaluate the consistency of results across architectural variations. This architectural cross-validation complemented the data-based cross-validation by assessing result stability across different modeling approaches.
    
    \item \textbf{Repeated evaluations}: The best-performing model was evaluated on the test set across multiple checkpoints to assess the stability of results over the training process. This temporal cross-validation provided insights into model convergence reliability.
    
    \item \textbf{Visualizations and interpretability}: Rather than relying solely on quantitative metrics, visualization techniques were employed to provide qualitative insights into model behavior across different data folds and architectures.
\end{enumerate}

The 3-fold cross-validation strategy revealed performance consistency across different subject groupings, with accuracy variance of approximately ±XXX\% between folds.
% TODO add actual accuracy variance and mention what it means plus describe standard deviation etc

\subsubsection{Progressive Architecture Comparison}

To validate the choice of fully 3D convolutional architectures, a systematic comparison was conducted across architectures with varying degrees of 3D feature extraction:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Pure 3D architecture}: R3D-18 with full 3D convolutions
    
    \item \textbf{Mixed 2D/3D architecture}: MC3-18 with a combination of 2D and 3D convolutions
    
    \item \textbf{Decomposed 3D architecture}: R2Plus1D-18 with (2+1)D convolutions that factorize 3D convolutions into separate spatial and temporal components
\end{enumerate}

This progression allowed systematic evaluation of the impact of dimensional processing on classification performance, with the hypothesis that architectures preserving full 3D spatial relationships would outperform those that partially decompose the volumetric information.

The evaluation methodology was designed to provide a comprehensive, unbiased assessment of model performance while accounting for the specific challenges and requirements of Alzheimer's disease classification from structural MRI data. The combination of diverse metrics, rigorous validation strategy, and comparative analysis provided a solid foundation for evaluating the effectiveness of the proposed approach.
